### About me
---
I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student of Department of DSAI, Faculty of IT, Monash University, supervised by [Asst. Prof. Bohan Zhuang](https://bohanzhuang.github.io/) and [Prof. Jianfei Cai](https://jianfei-cai.github.io/). Before joining [Monash Green AI lab](https://monashai.github.io/) in Monash University, I obtained my M.phil degree from University of Sydney, under the supervision of [Prof. Dacheng Tao](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/dacheng-tao.html) and [Dr. Jing Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9jH5v74AAAAJ&hl=en). 
I am interested in efficiency problems in deep learning scenarios, human parsing and few-shot learning!
